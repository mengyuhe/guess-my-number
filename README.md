# guess-my-number
A small number-guessing game integrated from a Udemy course project.

My version guess-my-number randomly generates a number between 1 and 99 and the user has certain number of chances to guess the secret number.

P.S.The origianl Udemy project allows to guess a number between 1 to 20. The CSS file is mainly based on the original work from the Udemy course.
